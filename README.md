# Code Patterns
This repository contains Java programs to print various star patterns. Each program demonstrates the use of nested loops to create different shapes and designs using asterisks (*).

## Files

- `app1.java`: Prints a right-angled triangle pattern.
- `app2.java`: Prints an inverted right-angled triangle pattern.

- `app3.java`: Prints a hollow rectangle pattern.
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.
3. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac app1.java`).
4. Run the compiled Java files using the Java runtime (e.g., `java app1`).
5. Observe the output patterns in the console.
## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
- A text editor or IDE for editing and running Java code.
## Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests for any improvements or additional patterns you would like to contribute.
